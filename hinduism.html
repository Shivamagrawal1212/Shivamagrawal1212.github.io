    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hinduism is one of the world’s oldest continuously practiced religious traditions.
        Rather than a single unified system, it represents a broad family of religious,
        philosophical, and cultural practices that developed over several millennia in
        the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism encompasses diverse beliefs, rituals, texts,
        and schools of thought, unified by certain shared concepts and historical roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike many religions founded by a single historical figure, Hinduism evolved
        gradually through the contributions of sages, philosophers, and communities.
        For this reason, it is often described as a “way of life” rather than a strictly
        defined religion.

    <!-- HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT -->
    <section>
      <h2>Historical Development</h2>
      <p>
        The origins of Hinduism can be traced to the ancient Indus Valley civilization
        (c. 2500–1500 BCE), followed by the Vedic period, during which the Vedas—the
        earliest sacred texts—were composed. These texts laid the foundation for ritual
        practices, cosmology, and social organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequent periods witnessed the development of the Upanishads, which emphasized
        philosophical inquiry into the nature of reality, the self, and ultimate truth.
        Later, the Epic and Puranic traditions popularized devotional practices and
        narratives through texts such as the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavad Gita.
      </p>

    <!-- CORE PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS -->
    <section>
      <h2>Core Philosophical Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dharma:</strong> Ethical duty, law, and righteous conduct.</li>
        <li><strong>Karma:</strong> The principle of action and its consequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Samsara:</strong> The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.</li>
        <li><strong>Moksha:</strong> Liberation from the cycle of samsara.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These concepts form the philosophical foundation of Hindu thought and influence
        moral behavior, social responsibilities, and spiritual aspirations.
      </p>

    <!-- SCRIPTURES AND TEXTS -->
    <section>
      <h2>Sacred Texts and Literature</h2>
      <p>
        Hindu literature is extensive and diverse, comprising texts composed over
        centuries. The Vedas are considered the oldest and most authoritative scriptures.
        The Upanishads explore metaphysical ideas, while the Epics and Puranas present
        religious teachings through stories, poetry, and mythology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bhagavad Gita, a part of the Mahabharata, holds a central place in Hindu
        philosophy, addressing duty, devotion, and spiritual liberation through dialogue.

    <!-- PRACTICES AND RITUALS -->

      <h2>Religious Practices and Rituals</h2>

        Hindu religious practice varies widely across regions and communities. Common
        practices include temple worship, household rituals, meditation, pilgrimage,
        fasting, and participation in festivals. Devotion (bhakti) plays a significant
        role, often directed toward deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, Devi, and their
        manifestations.

        traditions of South Asia. Concepts such as family duty, respect for learning,
        and reverence for nature are deeply embedded in Hindu cultural life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, Hindu thought has interacted with various social structures,
        reform movements, and philosophical debates, leading to continuous evolution.
